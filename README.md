# Coursework from UDemy's Real-World Website with HTML and CSS
Work that was done under Jonas Schmedtmann during the period of the ~37h course. Final Versions consist of the final intended work by Schmedtmann, and Starter Versions were what was 
filled in by myself, following alongside the lessons.
In terms of content, there's minimal differences asides from notes taken on my end for future-reference, based on choices made by Schmedtmann throughout the course.
